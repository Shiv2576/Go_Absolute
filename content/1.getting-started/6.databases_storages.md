1. What are the different join types in PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL supports various join types to combine data from multiple tables:

- Inner Join: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.
- Left Join: Retrieves all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table.
- Right Join: Retrieves all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table.
- Full Outer Join: Retrieves all records from both tables, matching records and non-matching records.
- Cross Join: Generates a Cartesian product of the two tables, resulting in all possible combinations of rows.
- Self Join: Joins a table with itself based on a common column.
