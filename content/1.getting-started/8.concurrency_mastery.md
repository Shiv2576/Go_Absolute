# Concurrency in Go


### Goroutines

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, They allow you to run concurrent task without manually handling the os threads.

```go 
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func printNumbers() {
	for i := 1 ; i <= 5 ; i++ {
		fmt.Println("Number , :", i)
		time.Sleep(300 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}

func main() {
	go printNumbers()
	
	fmt.Println("Main Function running...")
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Main function Ends...")
}
```

### Channels

Channels in go are built mechanism for safe communication between Goroutines.
They allow Goroutines to send and recieve values without using explicit locks(like mutex).

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func worker(ch chan string) {
	ch <- "Work completed"
}

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string)
	
	go worker(ch)
	
	message := <-ch // recieve message
	fmt.Println(message)
}

```

#### There are two type of Channels : 

#### Unbuffered Channels
Unbuffered channels block until both sender and receiver are ready. (Synchronous Behaviour)

```go

ch := make(chan int)

go func() {
    ch <- 10   // waits until someone receives
}()

fmt.Println(<-ch) // receives 10

```

### Buffered Channels
Buffered channels allow sending without an immediate receiver (up to buffer capacity).

```go

ch := make(chan string, 3)

ch <- "A"
ch <- "B"
ch <- "C"  // buffer is full now

for i := range ch {
	fmt.Println(i)
}
```
